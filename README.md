# PERSONALIZED NUTRITION AND DIET OPTIMIZATION USING AI/ML
The Personalized Nutrition and Diet Optimization project is intended to disrupt traditional ways people receive dietary advice by using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. It provides individualized nutrition plans by considering user centric details like age, weight, height, BMI and food preference (vegeterian or non vegeterian). The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm drives the recommendation engine, examining these inputs to shape meal and macronutrient allocation–proteins, fats, carbohydrates — based on desired health outcomes for each unique individual.

## Features
1.User Profile Customization: Users can set up profiles with specific health metrics, dietary preferences, and lifestyle information to receive personalized dietary guidance.

2.Personalized Nutrition Plans: Based on user data, the system generates customized nutrition plans tailored to individual goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or specific health conditions.

3.Dynamic Recipe Recommendations: The platform suggests meal options that align with user dietary goals and available ingredients, simplifying meal planning and improving adherence.

4.Adaptive Learning Mechanism: The system refines recommendations over time by learning from user feedback and updating health metrics, ensuring more relevant advice as users' needs evolve.

5.Health Data Tracking: Users can log health information (e.g., weight, BMI, blood pressure) regularly, enabling continuous monitoring and adjusting of dietary recommendations.


## Requirements
1.Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 11) for compatibility with machine learning frameworks.

2.Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the diet and recipe recommendation system.

3.Machine Learning Frameworks:  Scikit-Learn: A popular Python library for machine learning, Scikit-Learn is ideal for classical machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), linear regression, and clustering. Its simple API is suitable for quick prototyping and development of personalized diet recommendations.

4.IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.

5.Framework - Streamlit: An open-source Python framework specifically designed for creating interactive, web-based applications, especially useful in the field of data science and machine learning. It enables developers to quickly build and deploy data-driven applications without requiring extensive front-end coding.
